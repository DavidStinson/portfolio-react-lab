  title: 'Connect Four',
  description: 'Connect Four is an exciting game for two players. In this game, players choose to be Player One or Player Two. Player One uses a red token while Player Two uses an orange token. Players take turns dropping their tokens down into the game board. The game board has seven columns and six rows. A player can click on any part of a column on the board to have their token dropped in that corresponding column. The tokens will drop all the way down a column until it reaches the lowest space that is open. If a space is taken, the token will be placed above that space. The object of the game is to get four tokens of the same color in a row! Four in a row can be achieved vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In the event that the board is filled up with tokens and there are not four in a row, the game is a draw!',
